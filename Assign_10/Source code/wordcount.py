## CS 101 Lab
## Program Lab Week 12 - Test 2
## Date : Fall 2021
## Name: Tin Nguyen

##
##
## Problems: In this Exam you will ask the user for a text file to read.
##           Youâ€™ll want to read all the words and output a count of
##           the words that are used the most.
##
##
## Algorithm: Output the top 10 words that are used most.    
##            With the most frequently used words at the top.  
##            Exclude all words that are 3 characters or 
##            less. Output the number words that appear
##            only once. ( How many words are only used once )
##            ( Only words more than 3 characters )
##            Output how many unique words there are. 
##            ( Only words more than 3 characters )
##            Recover gracefully from the user providing an invalid file.
